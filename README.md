    ```
    - Open the `.env` file and add your database connection details. You can get these from your Railway dashboard.

    **.env.example for Backend:**
    ```
    # Port for the server to run on
    PORT=5000

    # Your Railway Database Connection Details
    DB_HOST=switchyard.proxy.rlwy.net
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=riunfLWFGLbyzMMKjdPIgJFvZVEIXZAo

    DB_PORT=13087
    ```

    - **Run the backend server:**
      ```bash
      npm start
      ```
    - The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the frontend folder from the root directory
    cd frontend 

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the frontend folder
    touch .env

    - Open the `.env` file and specify the backend API URL.

    **.env.example for Frontend:**
    ```
    # The URL of your running local backend server
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
    ```
